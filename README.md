- Amount and percentage assigned in alignment with targets
- Amount and percentage assigned not in alignment with targets
- Visual charts and interactive components

### Detailed Category Analysis
- Categories that received assignments above their targets
- Specific over-target amounts for each category
- Categories that received assignments but had no targets set
- Advanced filtering, sorting, and export capabilities

### Security & Performance
- Secure YNAB API integration with Personal Access Token
- Local-only processing with no data persistence
- Rate limiting compliance (200 requests/hour)
- Sub-3-second dashboard loading performance
