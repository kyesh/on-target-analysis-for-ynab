## Debug Information Interpretation

### Rule Identification

#### Rule 1: Monthly NEED

```
Rule: Rule 1: Monthly NEED
Calculation: goal_target = 40000
Result: $400.00 needed this month
```

#### Rule 2: Weekly NEED

```
Rule: Rule 2: Weekly NEED (5 occurrences)
Calculation: 25000 √ó 5 = 125000
Day: 4 (Thursday)
Month: 2024-12-01
Day Count: 5
Result: $1,250.00 needed this month
```

#### Rule 3: Months to Budget

```
Rule: Rule 3: Months to Budget
Calculation: (120000 + 0) √∑ 4 = 30000
Goal Overall Left: $1,200.00
Budgeted: $0.00
Months to Budget: 4
Result: $300.00 needed this month
```

#### Rule 6: Future Goal Creation

```
Rule: Rule 6: Future Goal Creation
Calculation: Goal created 2025-01-01 > analysis month 2024-12-01 ‚Üí 0
Goal Creation Month: 2025-01-01
Current Month: 2024-12-01
Result: $0.00 needed this month
```

### Field Interpretations

#### Goal Cadence Values

- `0`: One-time goal
- `1`: Monthly recurring
- `2`: Weekly recurring
- `13`: Yearly recurring

#### Goal Day Values (for weekly goals)

- `0`: Sunday
- `1`: Monday
- `2`: Tuesday
- `3`: Wednesday
- `4`: Thursday
- `5`: Friday
- `6`: Saturday

#### Goal Types

- `NEED`: Needed for Spending goals
- `TB`: Target Category Balance goals
- `TBD`: Target Category Balance by Date goals
- `MF`: Monthly Funding goals
- `DEBT`: Debt payoff goals

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Unexpected Calculation Results

1. **Check the applied rule**: Verify the correct rule is being used
2. **Review raw fields**: Ensure YNAB API data is as expected
3. **Validate date handling**: Check goal_creation_month and current month comparison
4. **Examine day counting**: For weekly goals, verify day occurrence calculations

### Rule Priority Issues

If a category is using an unexpected rule:

1. **Review rule priority order**: Rules are evaluated in specific sequence
2. **Check goal_creation_month**: Rule 6 takes precedence over other rules
3. **Verify cadence fields**: Weekly goals (Rule 2) override months-to-budget (Rule 3)
4. **Validate goal_months_to_budget**: Rule 5 handles zero/negative values

### Missing Debug Information

If debug panels don't appear:

1. **Ensure debug mode is enabled**: Toggle "Show Debug Information"
2. **Check category has goals**: Debug info only shows for categories with targets
3. **Verify category is included**: Hidden or deleted categories may be filtered out
4. **Refresh the page**: Clear any cached data

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### API Response Inspection

Use the debug API endpoint to examine raw YNAB data:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/debug/ynab-raw?budgetId=budget-uuid&month=2024-12-01"
```

### Console Logging

Enable browser console logging for additional debug information:

1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Navigate to Console tab**
3. **Look for calculation warnings** and error messages
4. **Check network requests** for API response details

### Calculation Validation

To validate calculations manually:

1. **Note the raw field values** from the debug panel
2. **Apply the calculation rule** shown in the debug information
3. **Compare with the displayed result**
4. **Check for rounding differences** (calculations use Math.round)

## Debug Panel Navigation

### Expanding/Collapsing Panels

- **Click the debug toggle button** (üîç) next to each category
- **Panels expand** to show full debug information
- **Click again to collapse** and reduce visual clutter
- **Multiple panels** can be open simultaneously

### Information Layout

Debug panels are organized in logical sections:

1. **Rule Summary**: Applied rule with color coding
2. **Raw API Fields**: Complete YNAB data with interpretations
3. **Calculation Details**: Step-by-step calculation breakdown
4. **Additional Context**: Error handling, fallbacks, special cases

## Performance Considerations

### Debug Mode Impact

- **Minimal performance impact**: Debug information is pre-calculated
- **Conditional rendering**: Only displayed when debug mode is enabled
- **Efficient updates**: Debug panels update automatically with data changes

### Large Budget Handling

For budgets with many categories:

- **Selective expansion**: Open only relevant debug panels
- **Use filtering**: Focus on specific category groups or types
- **Monitor browser performance**: Close unused panels if needed

## Integration with Testing

### Test Case Development

Debug information helps create comprehensive test cases:

1. **Document expected rules** for different goal configurations
2. **Capture edge cases** revealed through debug inspection
3. **Validate calculation formulas** against debug output
4. **Test rule priority** scenarios

### Regression Testing

Use debug mode to verify:

- **Calculation consistency** across application updates
- **Rule application accuracy** for complex goal types
- **Edge case handling** for unusual YNAB configurations
- **Performance stability** with debug information enabled

## PostHog Analytics Debugging

### Session Recording Issues

#### Problem: Session recordings not appearing in PostHog dashboard

**Verification Steps**:

1. **Check PostHog-JS Version**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   console.log(posthog.version); // Should show 1.252.1
   ```

2. **Monitor Network Requests**:
   - Open browser Developer Tools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Look for POST requests to `https://us.i.posthog.com/s/` (session recordings)
   - Look for POST requests to `https://us.i.posthog.com/e/` (events)
   - All requests should return 200 status codes

3. **Verify User Activity**:
   - Ensure substantial user interaction (minimum 30 seconds recommended)
   - Perform multiple actions: clicks, navigation, form interactions
   - Session recordings require meaningful user activity to be processed

**Common Solutions**:

- **Outdated PostHog-JS**: Upgrade to version 1.252.1 or later
- **Insufficient Activity**: Create longer, more interactive sessions
- **Network Issues**: Check for blocked requests or CORS errors
- **Configuration Issues**: Verify PostHog project settings allow session recordings

#### Problem: Recordings appear but are incomplete or corrupted

**Troubleshooting**:

1. **Check JavaScript Errors**:
   ```javascript
   // Monitor console for PostHog-related errors
   console.error.bind(console);
   ```

2. **Verify Session Recording Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   // Check PostHog configuration
   console.log(posthog.config);
   ```

3. **Review Masking Rules**:
   - Ensure masking rules aren't blocking essential content
   - Check `maskAllInputs` and `maskInputOptions` settings

### Event Tracking Issues

#### Problem: Custom events not appearing in PostHog

**Debugging Steps**:

1. **Verify Event Capture**:
   ```javascript
   // Test event capture in console
   posthog.capture('test_event', { test_property: 'test_value' });
   ```

2. **Check Event Properties**:
   - Ensure event names follow PostHog naming conventions
   - Verify property values are serializable
   - Check for special characters or reserved names

3. **Monitor Network Transmission**:
   - Look for POST requests to `/e/` endpoint
   - Verify events are included in request payload

### Performance Monitoring

#### PostHog Impact Assessment

1. **Monitor Page Load Times**:
   ```javascript
   // Check PostHog loading impact
   performance.getEntriesByName('posthog-js');
   ```

2. **Session Recording Performance**:
   - Monitor CPU usage during recording
   - Check memory consumption for long sessions
   - Verify no significant impact on user experience

This debugging system provides comprehensive visibility into both the calculation engine and analytics infrastructure, enabling thorough validation and troubleshooting of all application components.
